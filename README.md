## About
ChessV2 is a web application where you can play full games of chess against friends online!

This repository hosts the details for how the website is implemented and the logic for all legal chess moves . In chess-v2/src/helperFunctions you can find the logic for how the possible moves of each piece are generated and how I check if a player has won.

## How to play
1) Visit the link above and sign up for an account  
   a) _Note_: I wanted to try my hand at setting up authentication but I don't validate or 2FA email information so you can put a fake one if you want
2) If you have another person you want to play against, have them do the same. If you don't have another person available at the moment, open up a different browser and visit the site. Create a different account on the second browser
3) Enter the username of your friend or the second account you set up on your second browser and have the other account do the same. Once you have both requested to play each other, a match will begin!

## How to run the project locally
 1) Clone the repo
 2) Navigate to the chess-v2/server/src using the terminal
 3) Run `npm start`
 4) Open a browser and visit localhost:3001

Enjoy!
